> DIALOG and OPTIONS are shown bottom center

    FACE: Bart is smiling and seems in good spirits

    VIEW: Ship command console with button array, a single light is lit 

    DIALOG: 
* I'm sorry if this recording is arriving later than you would have hoped. No doubt the droids have finished work on the transmission array long after this recording. But none the less, I hope it finds you well and I hope you've forgiven me by now...


    OPTIONS:
* Those droids do love to take their sweet time, eh?

## Act 1
    FACE: Bart has tilted his head to one side and looks down

    VIEW: Ship command console with button array, more lights and small screen have lit up

    DIALOG:

* The port was pretty packed if I remember right? It's sure been a while. I've almost forgotten your face since the only possessions I was allowed to bring amounted to a pair of slacks and my flute...

* your lullaby remains pretty crystal clear though. I try to play it every day
