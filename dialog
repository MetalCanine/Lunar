Act 1 - Connection Avoided

** A bunch of shit about video call connections on the AstraNet (You are receiving a call from Terran Science Vessel Delta Eight Bravo

I wonder what this could be, now?

- Hey! Sorry, I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time

No, no, it's ok

- I just wanted to catch up. See How things were going. The droids finally got the communication array back up so...

Everything's fairly well here, you know, work is work

- Yeah, yeah. The terminal is telling me this might be audio only

How is work going for you?

- It's fine. The old rumble bus is still churning through the stars as always. Life's just difficult out here 

Oh. Yeah. Life's hard, sure

- ...

...

- So there were a few things I'd like to get off my chest. Something I really needed to say

Ok, whatever you want to say

Act 2 - Rage Against The Light Not Dying

- I know you did your best when we were kids, I know nothing was easy and it was just us three against the world, but why could you never be present for anything in our lives? What kept you so distant?

Dakota, that's just not true, I was always there for you
Dakota, I had to be able to live my own life 
Dakota, I couldn't function under the crushing weight of what we were up against

- You were never there! You kept us fed and clothed and housed when it was possible, but you never really took part in our lives

What more could I have possibly done?

- Charles left early on in life and you lingered as a husk. The joy in your eyes died and guarding it in our own grew harder and harder each passing year. You were a ghost materializing briefly each day to phase right through us. The last time I truly was able to break through and reach you I was a kid, do you remember that day?

I do, you talk about it a lot. Hide and Go Seek in the sun
I do, it's a hard day to forget. Flat bottled coke warmed in the summer air
I do, your sister had the biggest grin. I found your hiding spots from your giggles

- I was five. That was almost two decades ago

...

- I thought I had reached you another day as well. When I found you laying in bed, drugged from all the pills you had taken the night prior. After the ambulance came and we sat in your hospital room I thought we had grown closer but you must have resented me. Both of us had reached that point and I thought it would help us repair.

Why would you bring that up now?

- My sister and I, your very flesh and blood, have always been here for you 

What am I supposed to say to any of this?

Act 3 - Sadness Rocket Cruise

- I, uhmm, I don't know when I'll be able to speak to you next. These are all things you needed to know if

Yes?

- If I were to, y'know, take a while to get back into communications range

This is too much to process in such a short time. Why didn't you say any of this sooner?

- I... I didn't know how to!

That's certainly not my fault
You should've known how to
I taught you better than that

- When would I have? You were always preoccupied with chasing anyone who would show you any affection

How dare you

- How dare I!? The man you pined after for so long would beat us in drunken rages. I had to stand in the way of most of it so that he wouldn't harm you

I couldn't be alone I...

- He abused all of us constantly and you just stood by while he terrorized us

I couldn't move, I was so close to losing everything I worked for
I couldn't move, I needed to be loved by someone
I couldn't move, I was so frightened of losing myself

- I learned how to fight when I should have been enjoying a childhood I'll never get back. We had a second chance at childhoods after Charles left us and stole it with your apathy

...

- And now you can't accept me for what I've become. Who I am. I only asked repeatedly for you to care and you've never given me an answer

How could I? You're a monster
How could I? You're a demon
How could I? You're a freak

Act 4 - The Rocket Explodes, it's not funny

- I just...

(These options correspond to previous character choices)
Dakota, I don't know why(you feel this way)(I bothered with you all these years)(we were punished by the world).
We have our memories, (golden and bright,)(though they may have begun tarnished,)(shrouded in laughter,) and that should amount for something.
(You should let go of things out of your control)(You should learn to do better)(You should remember what I taught you).
(I didn't let you down)(It finally turned out that he did love me)(I'm all I'll ever need and you could be the same for yourself).
(You're a terror to everyone that looks upon you)(You're frightening and there's no help for you)(You're shameful and hurt everyone who comes near you).

- That's only fair

You have to accept this, I'm only telling you the truth and I can't do this anymore

- What held us together as functioning people so long? What could I have done or said to make you love me?

...

- You must despise everything I've become.

...

- I love you, Mom. Good Bye.
